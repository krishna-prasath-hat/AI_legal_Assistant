# ✅ MIGRATED TO GROQ CLOUD

## 🚀 Upgrade Complete
I have successfully migrated your AI provider from OpenAI to **Groq Cloud** as requested.

### **1. ⚡ Codebase Updated**
- **New Integration:** Added full support for Groq's high-speed API in `llm_reasoning.py`.
- **Dependencies:** Installed the `groq` Python SDK.

### **2. 🔑 Configuration Updated**
- **API Key:** Configured your provided Groq key (`gsk_...`).
- **Model:** Set to `llama3-70b-8192` (A powerful model comparable to GPT-4).

### **3. 🛡️ Status**
- **OpenAI:** Disconnected (to prevent `429` errors).
- **Groq:** **ACTIVE**.

## 🏁 How to Verify
1. **App is Restarting:** I triggered a restart. Wait ~30s.
2. **Go to:** `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Analyze:** Run your case again.
   - It will be **MUCH FASTER** (Groq is famous for speed).
   - The output will come from Llama-3-70B via Groq.

**Enjoy the speed!** ⚡
