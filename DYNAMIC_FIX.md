# ✅ REPORT & DRAFTING ENHANCED

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### **1. 🎨 Beautiful Markdown Reports**
I fixed the frontend styling issue.
- **Rich Text:** The "AI Analysis Summary" now properly renders headers, lists, and bold text.
- **Styling:** Headings like `### APPLICABLE LAWS` are now styled distinctively (Blue text, underlined), and `**IPC Sections**` are highlighted.

### **2. 🧠 Dynamic Recommendations**
I replaced the generic "rules" with **AI-Powered Logic**.
- **Next Steps:** Now generated specifically for *your* incident (e.g., "Block card" for fraud vs "File FIR" for theft).
- **Documents:** tailored to exact needs (e.g., "Screenshots" vs "Medical Report").
- **No More Generics:** The "predefined way" is gone.

### **3. 📝 Intelligent FIR Drafting**
- **Fixed:** The "Complaint regarding general" subject line.
- **Smart:** The drafter now auto-detects relevant laws if they weren't explicitly provided, ensuring the FIR always cites valid sections.

## 🏁 Verification
1. **Refresh** `http://localhost:3000`.
2. **Analyze** your incident again.
3. **Observe:**
   - The Report looks clean and structured.
   - "Next Steps" & "Documents" cards are specific to your story.
   - The FIR Draft is professional and filled with relevant details.

**Enjoy the upgraded experience!** ⚖️
